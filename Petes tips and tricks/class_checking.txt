Beware of checking using #class to check the type of an object. It's a potential problem if Fixnum ever goes away or is changed (and there's some evidence that it will go away someday, to be replaced by the Integer class.)

If you simply must distinguish between object types, use Kernel#respond_to? instead. You don't really need to do this here; a case statement can be used in this method to determine the appropriate score.
