You probably won't find "control variable" in the ruby docs; it's a more general term that applies to multiple languages. A control variable is a method argument that is only used to invoke different behaviors. With a class, the control variable may be assigned at initialization turn, but its only purpose is to alter behavior. In this case, it's the role variable you pass to your class during initialization and then use in show_hand solely to print something different for the player and dealer. Such control variables are considered to be "code smells"; not necessarily wrong, but a suggestion that something should be refactored. In this case, it's a suggestion that you need separate classes.
