# Write a pseudo code method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together


# Casual Pseudo Code:
#
Given an array of strings.

Save the first string of the array (first element of the array) to a variable.
Iterate through the array one string at a time.
  - for each iteration 'append' a single space to the saved string (to leave a space between the different concatenated strings).
  - for each iteration 'append' the next string to the saved string.

After iterating through the array of strings, return the saved string.


# Formal Pseudo Code:
#
START

# Given an array of strings: arr_str[].

SET concat_str = arr_str[0]
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator < length of arr_str
  append " " to the end of concat_str
  append arr_str[iterator] to the end of concat_str

  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT concat_str

END
