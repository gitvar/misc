# Write a pseudo code method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element


# Casual Pseudo Code:
#
Given an array of integers.

Define a new array.
Iterate through the array one integer at a time.
  - for each iteration determine if the index is odd or even
    - if the iterator value is odd, push the value of the given array at this iterator onto the new array.
    - if the iterator is even, do nothing

After iterating through the array of integers, return the new array.



# Formal Pseudo Code:
#
START

# Given an array of integers: arr_ints[].

SET arr_every_other[] = 0
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator < arr_ints.length
  IF iterator % 2 != 0
    arr_every_other << arr_ints[iterator]

  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT arr_every_other[]

END
